# The Reasoned Schemer (in Racket)

My experimentations and exercies while working through the book.  I'm using Racket 5.2.

To run all of the files just use the _racket_ binary, for example...

```
racket 01-playthings.rkt
```

Ideally there should be no output as all tests will pass.  "Ideally" :D

## Racket
